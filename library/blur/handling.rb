module Blur
  class Client
    # The +Handling+ module is the very core of the IRC-part in Blur.
    #
    # When the client receives a parsed command instance, it immediately starts
    # looking for a got_(the command name) method inside the client, which
    # is implemented in this module.
    #
    # == Implementing a handler
    # Implementing a handler is very, very easy.
    #
    # All you need to do is define a method named got_(command you want to
    # implement) that accepts 2 parameters, +network+ and +command+.
    #
    # You can then do whatever you need to do with the command instance,
    # you can access the parameters of it through {Network::Command#[]}.
    #
    # Don't forget that this module is inside the clients scope, so you can
    # access all instance-variables and methods.
    #
    # @example
    #   # RPL_WHOISUSER
    #   # <nick> <user> <host> * :<real name>
    #   def got_whois_user network, command
    #     puts "nick: #{command[0]} user: #{command[1]} host: #{command[2]} â€¦"
    #   end
    #   
    # @see http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/chapter6.html
